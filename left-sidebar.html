											<p>The Chevrolet Lacetti is a compact car manufactured and marketed globally by GM Korea since 2002. The first-generation Lacetti was available as a four-door sedan and five-door station wagon, styled by Pininfarina—and five-door hatchback styled by Giorgetto Giugiaro. The sedan and wagon were marketed as the chevrolet Nubira in some European markets and as the Suzuki Forenza in North America. The hatchback, was introduced in 2004 and marketed as Chevrolet Lacetti5 in South Korea, Suzuki Reno in the United States. After the 2004 model year, it was marketed as Chevrolet Nubira and Lacetti in Europe, as the Chevrolet Optra in Canada, Latin America, Africa, Middle East, India, Japan and Southeast Asia, and as the Holden Viva in Australia and New Zealand.</p>

											<h3>Gentra in UzAuto</h3>
											<p>If the appearance of the car is important to you, then Lacetti is for you. This car with a healthy exterior and interior is
											harmoniously embodied in all aspects of proportion, smooth beautiful shape, and expressive lines. Lacetti's compact stylish
											interior seats five people comfortably. The instrument panel is distinguished by its proportions and variety.
											The arrangement of chrome-plated elements and instruments is carefully thought out.
											Its running characteristics have been thoroughly tested and brought to a perfect level.</p>

											<p>The smooth modern design of the Lacetti body is the achievement of the famous car atelier Pininfarina (Italy).
												The almond-shaped headlamps and long, sleek lines give it an attractive look.
												With its luxurious design and spacious interior, the 4-door Lacetti is more than just a family sedan,
												it's a great car that clearly shows that a practical car can't be faulted.
												It's the epitome of all-round quality, with plenty of extra features and excellent handling.</p>
